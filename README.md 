# MPBoana

MPBoana is a FastAPI-powered application for analyzing text. It provides endpoints for both **sentiment analysis** (using the MeaningCloud API) and **political view classification** (using Hugging Face transformers). The project is designed to work with Portuguese text but can easily be adapted for other languages.
